# FlitViewComponents
This is a set of Rails View Components aimed at mimicking Flutter's Widgets. I'm new to Flutter, and not much of a designer, so I'm attempting to do this via tools I am familiar with.

I need a flexible design tool, and I plan on using [json_dynamic_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget) once I know what I'm doing with Flutter. First, though, I need static widgets.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
